## Introduction
# SuperHeroes Project

## Overview
The SuperHeroes Project is a Spring Boot application that demonstrates the integration of MongoDB and AWS services (S3 and SQS) using LocalStack for local development and testing. The application manages a collection of superhero data stored in MongoDB and interacts with AWS services emulated by LocalStack.

## Features
- Store superhero data in a MongoDB database.
- Upload files to S3 and manage queues in SQS using LocalStack.
- Provides RESTful endpoints to interact with the data and services.

## Prerequisites
- **Java 17**: Ensure you have Java 17 or higher installed.
- **Docker**: Required to run LocalStack and MongoDB containers.
- **Maven**: Used for building the Spring Boot project.
- **AWS CLI**: To interact with LocalStack services from the command line.

## Installation

### Setup MongoDB and LocalStack with Docker
```bash
# Run MongoDB
docker run --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 -d mongo:latest

# Run LocalStack
docker run --name localstack-main -p 4566:4566 -p 4510-4560:4510-4560 -d localstack/localstack
## Features
- üåü Insert a new superhero using POST requests.
- üîç Retrieve superhero details by name or universe using GET requests.
- üîÑ Update existing superhero details using PUT requests.
- ‚ùå Delete a superhero by name using DELETE requests.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** ‚Äì Core programming language
- **Spring Boot** ‚Äì Framework for building REST APIs
- **MongoDB** ‚Äì NoSQL database for storing superhero data
- **Docker** ‚Äì For containerizing the application
- **Postman** ‚Äì For testing and API interactions


## Installation
To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vaibhav-Ct/SuperHeroes-Memory.git

2. Build the application:
./mvnw clean install

4. ./mvnw spring-boot:run
Verify: The application should be running on http://localhost:8080.

5. Running the Application
Once the application is running, you can interact with it using:

### POST - Insert a New Superhero
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/superhero" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Iron Man", "power": "Genius Intellect", "gender": "Male", "age": 45, "universe": "Marvel"}'

### GET - Retrieve All Superheroes
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/heroes"

### GET - Retrieve Superheroes by Name or Universe
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/superhero?name=Iron%20Man"

curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/superhero?universe=Marvel"

### PUT - Update Superhero Details
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/api/superheroes/Iron%20Man" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"power": "Advanced Technology", "age": 46}'

### DELETE - Delete a Superhero
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/api/superheroes/Iron%20Man"

### Endpoints
Insert a superhero: POST /api/superhero
Insert many superheroes: POST /api/superheroes
Update a superhero: PUT /api/superheroes/{name}
Delete a superhero: DELETE /api/superheroes/{name}
Retrieve by name or universe: GET /api/superhero

### Database
The project uses MongoDB as the database to store superhero records. The MongoDB container is running locally on http://localhost:27017.

### Running MongoDB with Docker
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb-container mongo:6.0.20
